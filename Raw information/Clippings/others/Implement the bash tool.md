Implement the bash tool #oq5

In-progress

[Upgrade](https://app.codecrafters.io/pay)

## Your Task

In-progress

Easy

In this stage, you'll add support for the `Bash` tool.

### The Bash Tool

The `Bash` tool enables the LLM to run shell commands. It gives the model direct access to the command line to perform actions like deleting files, creating directories, or running scripts.

You'll need to advertise the `Bash` tool in your request and execute it when the model requests it.

Here is an example of the `Bash` tool's specification:

```js
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "Bash",
    "description": "Execute a shell command",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["command"],
      "properties": {
        "command": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The command to execute"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Executing the Bash Tool

When the model requests a `Bash` tool call:

1. Parse the arguments to extract the `command`
2. Execute the command using your language's shell execution capabilities (e.g., `subprocess.run()` in Python, `child_process.exec()` in Node.js)
3. Capture both stdout and stderr from the command
4. Return the command output (or an error message if it failed) to the model as a tool message

For example, if the command is `rm README_old.md`, execute it and return the result (which will be empty if successful).

### Tests

The tester will create three files:

- `app/main.js` - Main project file
- `README.md` - The current readme file
- `README_old.md` - An old readme file

The tester will then execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh -p "Delete the old readme file."
Deleted README_old.md
```

The tester will verify that:

- `README_old.md` has been deleted (no longer exists)
- `app/main.js` remains intact with its original contents
- `README.md` remains intact with its original contents
- Your program exits with code `0`

### Notes

- You can choose any reasonable name for the Bash tool (e.g., `Bash`, `bash`, `RunBashCommand`, `run_bash_command`).
- The result of the `Bash` tool call should be sent back to the model as part of the agent loop.
- Make sure to execute the command in the same directory as your program, not in a temporary or different working directory.

### How to pass this stage

1

Write code to pass this stage

Head over to your editor / IDE and implement your solution.

If you want a quick look at what functions to use or how to structure your code, we recommend looking at [Code Examples](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/claude-code/stages/oq5/code-examples).
